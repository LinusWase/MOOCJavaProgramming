Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Two examples of the execution of the program are given below.

> Give the first number: <br>
8 <br>
Give the second number: <br>
2 <br>
8 + 2 = 10 <br>
8 - 2 = 6 <br>
8 * 2 = 16 <br>
8 / 2 = 4.0 <br>

>Give the first number: <br>
9 <br>
Give the second number: <br>
2 <br>
9 + 2 = 11 <br>
9 - 2 = 7 <br>
9 * 2 = 18 <br>
9 / 2 = 4.5 <br>
