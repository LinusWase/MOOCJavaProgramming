# Multiplication formula

Similar to the previous exercise, create a program that multiplies the values stored in two integer variables.

For instance, if the entered numbers are 2 and 8, the program should print the following:
### Sample output

>Give the first number: <br>
2 <br>
Give the second number: <br>
8 <br>
2 * 8 = 16 <br>

Likewise, if the entered numbers are 277 and 111, the print should be the following:
### Sample output

>Give the first number: <br>
277 <br>
Give the second number: <br>
111 <br>
277 * 111 = 30747 <br>
