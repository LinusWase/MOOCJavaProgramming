# Checking the age
Write a program that prompts the user to input their age and checks whether or not it is possible (at least 0 and at most 120). Only use a single if-command in your program.

> How old are you? 10 <br>
OK 

> How old are you? 55 <br>
OK

> How old are you? -3 <br>
Impossible!

> How old are you? 150 <br>
Impossible!
