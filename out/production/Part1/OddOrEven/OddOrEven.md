# Odd or even

Write a program that prompts the user for a number and informs us whether it is even or odd.

> Give a number: <br>
2 <br>
Number 2 is even. <br>

>  Give a number: <br>
7 <br>
Number 7 is odd. <br>

Hint: The remainder when dividing by 2 tells us whether the number is even or not. We get the remainder using the %-operator. The exercise template contains additional instructions on how to do the checking using the remainder.
