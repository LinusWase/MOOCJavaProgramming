# Conversation

Write a program that works as follows:
### Sample output

>Greetings! How are you doing? <br>
>Good thank you! <br>
>Oh, how interesting. Tell me more! <br>
>Well, there's really nothing to tell. <br>
>Thanks for sharing! <br>
>Sample output <br>

>Greetings! How are you doing? <br>
>Nice and dandy like cotton candy! <br>
>Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!<br>
>Just went shopping. <br> 
>Thanks for sharing!<br>

The exercise template already includes the code that creates the Scanner tool.
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Conversation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        //Write your program here
    }
}
```
