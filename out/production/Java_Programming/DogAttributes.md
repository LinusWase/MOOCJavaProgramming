# Dog attributes
In this exercise, you'll practice creating a class.
You have now created a class called Dog. Add the variables private String name,private String breed and private int age to the class. As a class diagram, the class looks like this:

<pre>
Dog
- name: String
- breed: String
- age: int
</pre>

The class doesn't do much yet. However, practicing this step is valuable for what is to come.
