# Java Programming: University of Helsinki MOOC Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and exercises completed as part of the **University of Helsinki's (MOOC) Java Programming course**.

This course covers the fundamentals of computer programming, algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the Java language.

## Project Structure

The course is split into two main parts, each containing seven sub-parts with extensive programming exercises.

My solutions are organized into **IntelliJ Modules** or **Source Root folders** following the course structure:

| Folder/Module | Corresponding Course Part |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Part1` | Java Programming I (Parts 1-7) |
| `Part2` | Java Programming II (Parts 8-14) |

Within each `Part` folder, exercises are separated into modules and directorys corresponding to the chapter's topics.

## Technology and Setup

* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and Virtual Studio Code (for testing)
* **Language:** Java
* **Tools:** Built primarily around the **Test My Code** environment/structure used for automated testing in the course.

### Running the Code

These solutions are intended for self-study and reference.

To run a specific exercise in IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Navigate to the class file containing the `main(String[] args)` method.
2. Right-click on the file or inside the editor.
3. Select **Run 'ClassName.main()'**.
