# Song2

Create a class called Song2. The song has the instance variables name (string) and length in seconds (integer). Both are set in the public Song2(String name, int length) constructor. Also, add to the object the methods public String name(), which returns the name of the song, and public int length(), which returns the length of the song.

The class should work as follows.

```
Song2 garden = new Song2("In The Garden", 10910);
System.out.println("The song " + garden.name() + " has a length of " + garden.length() + " seconds.");
```

> The song In The Garden has a length of 10910 seconds.
