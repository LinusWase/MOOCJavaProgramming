# From where to where? (2 parts)
This exercise is the first two-part exercise. When you complete both parts, you will get two exercise points. You can also submit the exercise after completing only the first part.

## Part 1: Where to
Write a program which prints the integers from 1 to a number given by the user.

> Where to? 3 <br>
1 <br>
2 <br>
3 <br>

> Where to? 5 <br>
1 <br>
2 <br>
3 <br>
4 <br>
5 <br>

__hint__ the number read from the user is now the upper limit of the condition. Remember that in Java a <= b means a is 
smaller or equal to b.

## Part 2: Where from
Ask the user for the starting point as well.

 > Where to? 8 <br>
 Where from? 5 <br>
 5 <br>
 6 <br>
 7 <br>
 8 <br>

If the upper limit is smaller than the starting point, nothing is printed:

> Where to? 12 <br>
Where from? 16 <br>

__NB__ remember that the lower and upper limits can be negative!
