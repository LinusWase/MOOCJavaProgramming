# Counting to hundred

Write a program, which reads an integer from the user. Then the program prints numbers from that number to 100. You can assume that the user always gives a number less than 100. Below are some examples of the expected functionality.

> *99* <br>
99 <br>
100 <br>

>*-4*
-4 <br>
-3 <br>
-2 <br>
-1 <br>
0 <br>
1 <br>
2 <br>
... (many numbers in between) ... <br>
98 <br>
99 <br>
100 <br>
