# Sum of a sequence
Implement a program, which calculates the sum 1+2+3+...+n where n is given as user input.

### Sample output:
>Last number? 3 <br>
The sum is 6

The previous example calculated 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

> Last number? 7 <br>
The sum is 28

And this one calculated 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
