# Reprint
Expand the previous program so that the main program asks the user for the number of times the phrase will be printed (i.e. how many times the method will be called).

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // ask the user for the number of times that the phrase will be printed
    // use the while command to call the method a suitable number of times
}

public static void printText() {
    // write some code in here
}
```

### Sample output:

> How many times? <br>
7 <br>
In a hole in the ground there lived a method <br>
